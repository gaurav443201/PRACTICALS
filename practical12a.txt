The library was silent, except for the ticking clock on the wall.  
Books were stacked high, papers scattered across the table, and a warm cup of tea sat untouched.  
Julia sighed. She had been studying for hours, her eyes tired, her mind racing.  
Outside, the wind howled, rain tapping gently against the window.  
It was the perfect evening to stay in, to read, to reflect.  
Time moved slowly, pages turned, and thoughts wandered freely.
